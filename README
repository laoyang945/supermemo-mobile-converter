# Motivation
This python script is used to generate supermemo course via tab delimited text files.
It can convert the source file to a QA format, which can be used in the supermemo on iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch.  

# Usage
- After install python (2.7+), run the script directly
- Make sure that your source text is encoded in UTF-8. I strongly recommand copy from excel to notepad/other editor.
- The phonetic symbol should be "Ksphonet" by Kingsoft
