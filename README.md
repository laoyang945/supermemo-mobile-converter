# Motivation
This python script is used to generate supermemo course from tab delimited text files.
It can convert the source file to a QA format, which can be used in the supermemo on iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch.  
You can choose randomly or normally generate the QA file from your source.

# Usage
- Make sure that your source text is encoded in UTF-8 and tab delimited.
- After install python (2.7+), run the script directly
- The phonetic symbols should be of the font "Ksphonet" by Kingsoft
